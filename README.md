 TES

This aspires to be somewhat of a AwsKinesis/Kafka copy with very few features. In the present moment, it emulates a Kinesis shard through a http api. The focus of this project is to learn about low level multithreading in rust.

# Requirements
- Cargo https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

# Features

## HTTP API

As it emulates kinesis, there are 3 main operations: PutRecords, GetShardIterator and GetRecords. A ShardIterator is a number that points to the consumer's present position in the consumption of the stream.
To make a GetRecords request, you must supply a ShardIterator.
### Run
```
mkdir ./mount-data-here
cargo run -- --mount_path ./mount-data-here --port 8080
```

### Put Records
the endpoint /put-records accepts a json with the base64 encoded data you want to insert in the 'records' field
```
PUT_RECORDS_DATA="{\"records\":\"$(echo 'hello, world' | base64)\"}"
curl -i localhost:8080/put-records --data $PUT_RECORDS_DATA -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```

### Get Shard Iterator
```
curl -i localhost:8080/get-shard-iterator -d '{"iterator_type":"Oldest"}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```
This should return HTTP200, and 'shard iterator: 0'

### Get Records
Using the retrieved shard iterator,
```
curl -i localhost:8080/get-records/<shard-iterator>
```

# TO DO
- More tests
- Allow getting shard iterator by timestamp
- Delete old log-segments. This might depend on timestamp or on max offset.
- multiple shards (list shards, add shards)
- Replication
- Clustering etc
- remove/merge shards?
